Project Proposal:<br>
<br>
The Mental Health Matters project is a mental health awareness created by Khieran Gallardo, Johlan Marie Estañol, Maricon de los Reyes, Malkishua Java, and Kyle Andag. All of our members believe that most people think of mental health as nothing. That's the reason why there's a lot of bullying, abuse, and much more. They get worse because of carelessness.<br>
<br>
In this project, we all aim to stop bullying, stop abuse, and most importantly, spread awareness about mental health to make people who have it at its lowest, know that they are not alone.<br>
<br>
Introduction:<br>
<br>
Mental Health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every step of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.<br>
<br>
When people don't take care of their mental health. Letting themselves get bullied, abused, hurt frequently, would cause drastic changes to their mental health. It would make them depressed. It would make their and other's life miserable.<br>
<br>
The Church believes that people should treat people with mental health problems equally. They should give them support and care for them so that they know they are not alone.<br>
<br>
Rationale:<br>
<br>
This kind of project aims at a person who is experiencing mental health problems in their life. Mental Health Awareness advocacy project provides a reminder to the people that mental health is essential and that those living with mental health<br>
issues are deserving care, understanding, compassion, and pathways to hope, healing, recovery, and fulfillment. Also, this advocacy project can increase the chances for early intervention, which can result in a fast recovery. And mental health is very important for living a stable,<br>
and healthy life. Also, awareness about mental health can help people to understand the symptoms, find a professional treatment, and perhaps most importantly, community awareness for mental health reduces and breaks the mental health stigma that leaves so many people suffering in secret.<br>
This project also aims to stop acts that can lead to mental health issues. Acts such as bullying and all types of abuse. Stopping these acts can lead to a better environment for everyone, especially people with mental health issues.<br>

<br>
-Treat yourself with kindness and respect, and avoid self-criticism. Make time for your hobbies and favorite projects,<br>
or broaden your horizons. Do a daily crossword puzzle, plant a garden, take dance lessons, learn to play an instrument,<br>
or become fluent in another language.<br>
2. Take care of your body<br>
<br>
-Taking care of yourself physically can improve your mental health. Be sure to: Eat nutritious meals,<br>
Avoids smoking and vaping, Drink plenty of water, Exercise, which can helps decrease depression and anxiety<br>
and improve moods, Get enough sleep. Researchers believe that lack of sleep contributes to a high rate of depression<br>
in students.<br>
<br>
3. Surround yourself with good people<br>
<br>
-People with strong family or social connections are generally healthier than those who lack a support network.<br>
Make plans with supportive family members and friends, or seek out activities where you can meet new people,<br>
such as club, class or support group.<br>
<br>
4. Quiet your mind<br>
<br>
-Try meditating, Mindfulness and/ or prayer. Relaxation exercises and prayer can improve your state of mind<br>
and outlook on life. In fact research shows that meditation help you feel calm and enhance the effects of therapy.<br>

<br>
5. Avoid alcohol and other drugs<br>
<br>
-Keep alcohol use to a minimum and avoid other drugs. Sometimes people use alcohol and other drugs to<br>
"self-medicate" but in reality, alcohol and other drugs only aggravate problems.<br>
<center> Prayer: </center> <br>
<br>
O God, our liberation and shalom, we seek the power of your Spirit, that we may live in fuller union with you,<br>
ourselves, and our sisters and brothers with mental illness. Also grant that we may gain courage to love<br>
and understand each other. Amen.<br>
<br>
Acknowledgment:<br>
<br>
We assume that each member of the group acknowledge the importance of awareness about the mental health problem<br>
and we should know that mental health is one of the most important matters in our life.<br>
<br>
We'd like to acknowledge people suffering from mental health issues that they are not alone and that they are loved.<br>
We'd also like to acknowledge our gratitude towards therapists, counselors, and people that care for their loved ones<br>
that are suffering from mental health issues, for giving them support and love.<br>
