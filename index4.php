<th> Summary of the Video: </th>
<th> Angela Duckworth, formerly a seventh grade Math teacher noticed that her students were 
unbalanced. Her worst students scored well while her best students didn't do as well as she 
expected. At first, she thought it was about their IQs but she knew it was something more. 
After knowing that, she quit her job as a teacher and went to graduate school to become a 
psychologist. She then conducted experiments to know what makes people persevere through 
difficult tasks. She studied military cadets, National Bee competitors, rookie teachers and 
salespersons. Her question while studying them is "Who is succesful here and why?". 
She found the reason and the reason is grit. Grit is passion and sustained persistence applied 
toward long-term achievement, with no particular concern for rewards or recognition along the way. 
After knowing that, she studied a highschool and it turned out that grittier students are most 
likely to graduate. She thinks that the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know about 
it. We don't even know how to build grit in people. The closest thing to building grit is through 
having a growth mindset. It's about believing that the ability to learn is not fixed. Thinking 
that failure is not the end, instead its a way to learn more and develop. Though, even with that 
idea, we need more and that's the work that stands before us. </th>

<th> Speech Content: <br> <br>
Introduction: <br> 
(How did the speech start?) </th>
<th> The speech started by Angela Lee Duckworth telling the job she left when she was 27 years old 
which is a demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even of more demanding which is 
teaching and she went to teach 7th graders math in the New York city public school, and she say that 
she is just like to any teachers that also made quizzes, task, and give out homework and assignments 
and when the work is done and came back to her she also calculated grades. And there is one thing that 
struck her which that the "IQ was not the only difference between her best and worst students." She 
also share that" After many years of teaching I came to the conclusion that what we need in education 
is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a 
psychological perspective. " She began also to ask the question, " What if your ability to do well in 
school to learn quickly and easily? </th>

<tr>
<th> Body: <br> 
(What were the main points?) </th>
<th> These questions led her to graduate school where she became a psychologist who studied kids and adults 
in a full range of challenging settings to determine who was successful and why. And through her work 
experience by studying the behavior shown by the kids and adults, there is one characteristic that emerged 
as a significant predictor of success. This characteristic was not "social intelligence, good looks, physical 
health, or IQ it was grit." And she defines grit as "having stamina" and focusing on pursuing your future goals 
and sticking with those beyond a few weeks or months. Instead, gritty people stick with their goals for years, 
"working really hard to make that future happen." They see life "as a marathon, not a sprint. </th>

<tr>
<th> Conclusion: <br> 
(How did the speech end?) </th>
<th> The speech ended by Angela cites an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dwek, PhD on growth 
mindset as the best idea she has heard by building grit in kids it's something called "Growth mindset," 
she says, " is the belief that the ability to learn isn't fixed. It can change with your effort." She shares 
Dr. Dweck's work that when young people "learn about the brain and how it grows in response to a challenge, 
they are more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't believe failure is a permanent condition. 
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit, but we need more, and that is where I end my remark 
because that’s where we are that’s work that stands before us." In Angela Lee Duckworth's words. 
"We need to take our best ideas, strongest intuitions, test and measure them. We have to be willing to fail, 
to be wrong, and start over again with lessons learned. </th>

<tr>
<th> Delivery Skills and Techniques <br> 
(What are the best/worst delivery skills/techniques of the speaker?) </th>
<th> Personally in our opinion the best speech was where grit was introduced and 
enhanced to the public and where she stated that educational is about that particular thing and wasn’t 
from knowledge. The worst delivery was that the part where grit wasn’t mention yet and mentions that 
school is about knowledge and not about the personal stuff. </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> Bias/Prejudice <br>
(Did the speaker show bias? Why? Why not? </th>
<th> The speaker showed a speech that’s more of an opinion-based. Others would disagree but in our 
perspective would not be a problem. She delivered an informative speech on how education system works. 
She specified that it isn’t about knowledge but rather on the student’s grit or perseverance and passion. 
What she means is that it’s not about the brain and a student intelligence but rather on their passion. 
What kind of passion, well the answer is on yourself. It’s about a student choice and cannot be known until 
the student speaks about it. She has her own point and us have our own too but for us we agree. 
Education isn’t just brain thinking but rather being positive and motivated. </th>

<th> Ted Talk Review
<br>
<br>
(Would you recommend this video to fellow students? Explain.) </th>
<th> I agree with her point. Grit something that can be developed. Although I must admit that IQ is a determinant 
in perfect score, perseverance is a far more a leading factor of success. After watching this video, 
I am confident now to conquer the difficulties with grit. </th>
